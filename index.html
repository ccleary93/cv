                <p class="skill-list">Excel VBA</p>
                <p>I started programming a few years ago by learning Excel VBA to automate an admin process in my role at
                BP. Finding that I really enjoyed the process of development, I continued to program in my spare time as a
                hobby, and I now aim to make it my main focus in a junior developer role.</p>
                <p>In addition to the practical skills demonstrated by my portfolio, I have a basic understanding of computer
                 science fundamentals including algorithms, data structures and big O notation, and I've
                    learned about networking and server configuration by using a VPS to host and run my projects.</p>

                <p>I wanted to find a programmatic way of identifying ebay auctions where the item was
                underpriced relative to its average sale price, so I could purchase videogames for resale.
                <br><br>
                Finding that the ebay sold items API had been deprecated, and that its replacement was only accessible to
                approved ebay partners, I set out to create a web scraper that would build a Postgresql database of sold
                    games so I could replicate the API's functionality.
                <br><br>
                I then created a web frontend that leverages this data to deliver useful insights in a user-friendly manner.
                The 'snipe auctions' feature can be used to spot underpriced auctions ending soon.</p>

                        teaches C, and while C is not the most practical language for building modern applications quickly,
                     I now realise that this was excellent for my development since it necessitates learning about CS concepts.
                     As C has no automatic memory management and requires the use of pointers to create data structures,
                     it forces you to think actively about memory usage, which is a skill that carries over to programming in
                     higher level languages such as python.</p></td>
